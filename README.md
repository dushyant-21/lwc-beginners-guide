A hands-on guide to building custom Lightning Web Components.

**Project: Customer Feedback Application**  
For a practical scenario, you could create a Customer Feedback Application. Here's how each branch could contribute to the project:  
  
Main Branch: Basic setup of the app with a navigation structure.  
Branch 1 (Basic LWC Component): Create a simple feedback form that captures customer name, email, and feedback message.  
Branch 2 (API Integration): Enhance the form by integrating with an external sentiment analysis API to assess the feedback's sentiment (positive, neutral, negative).  
Branch 3 (Lightning Data Service): Use LDS to display existing feedback records from a custom Salesforce object without using Apex.  
Branch 4 (LWC with Apex): Add a feature where feedback submissions trigger an Apex call that performs additional data processing or validation.  
Branch 5 (Dynamic Interactivity): Implement a feature where the feedback list automatically updates when new feedback is submitted using Pub/Sub or custom events.  
Branch 6 (Custom Styles and SLDS): Ensure the feedback form and list have a polished look with SLDS and responsive design tweaks.  
Branch 7 (Testing LWC): Include Jest tests to validate the functionality of the feedback form, API integration, and event handling.
